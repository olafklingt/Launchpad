DESCRIPTION::
The Interface is designed around the concept that you like to make your launchpad behave like a GUI with Buttons and Sliders.

To use the Lauchpad clases it has to be initialized with Lauchpad.initMIDI .

The class gets mostly used for the GetRange function that returns a LPRange that holds references to the Launchpad LED-Buttons.

Example of creating a button on the launchpad
code::
Launchpad.initMIDI; // before the Launchpad can be used it has to be initialized
(
a = LPButton(Launchpad.getRange(0,0,0,0),{"Do something when the button is put to the front of the Launchpad.".postln},{"Do something when it is hidden from the Launchpad.".postln});
a.states = [LPLED.green,LPLED.red,LPLED.yellow];
a.action = {|b| "Print Current state:".post; b.value.postln; };
a.front;
)
a.hide;// to hide the gui element

METHOD:: getRange
A method to get a Range on the launchpad to put a GUI-element on it.

ARGUMENT:: fx
from value X

ARGUMENT:: fy
and value Y

ARGUMENT:: tx
to value X

ARGUMENT:: ty
and value Y

returns:: a LPRange

METHOD:: resetPads

ARGUMENT:: x
position on the x axis.

ARGUMENT:: y
position on the y axis.

ARGUMENT:: val
a velocity value (which has to be Coded according to the Lauchpad Manual).
to generate proper velocities use LPLED.

code::
Launchpad.setLED(1,2,LPLED.amber(3).vel);
Launchpad.setLED(2,4,LPLED.green(2).vel);
Launchpad.setLED(3,5,LPLED.red(1).vel);
::
